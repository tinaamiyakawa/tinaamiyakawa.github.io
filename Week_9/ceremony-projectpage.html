                <p><em>Ceremony: Valuable Processes for the Future</em>, is a speculative publication driven by an interest in the generation and destruction of content and the act of making. The action is always more valuable than the result. All images were created at random using a combination of found materials such as twigs, leaves and paper. All images were destroyed immediately after as a practice and recognition of impermanence. </p>
