        <h2>Sites I Like</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="http://www.teamthursday.com"><strong>Team Thursday</strong></a>
                    </li>
                <p> This is a portfolio site for the Rotterdam-based design studio <strong>Team Thursday.</strong> In addition to being the style of graphic design I am drawn to, and the fact that I love every single of on their projects, I think the site functions nicely from both a designer and client perspective. I enjoy its simplicity, attention to detail, and usability. A portfolio site should be thoughful and considered, without overshadowing or detracting from the work itself. An additional challenge with minimalist typography and web design, is the tendency to feel default. This does not feel default. </p>
                    <li> 
                        <a href="http://www.austinredman.com/"> <strong>Austin Redman</strong></a>   
                    </li>
                 <p> I think this site is really beautiful. There are a lot of factors which make it interesting; the attention to detail, the uniformity, the typography. I like that it's easy to navigate and that it shows off the abilities of the designer in both print and digital formats simultaneously.

                    <li>
                        <a href="http://sunnyinthepark.com/#2"> Sunny Park</a>
                    </li>
                    <p> Site by Sunny Park, graphic designer and graduate of Yale MFA. Interesting navigation, clear, concise, functional, unique but doesn't distract from her work.

        <h2>Sites I Dislike</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li> 
                            <a href="http://www.alessandrorisso.com"> <strong>Alessandro Rorisso</strong></a>
                        </li>
                <p> I dislike this site because I feel like it was treated as a printed platform instead of digital. The type is too small and decorative. Seems like its trying too hard. </p>
