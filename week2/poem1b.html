<h2>
what can we do? 
<br>
by charles bukowski
</h2>
<p> 
    at their best, there is <strong>g e n t l e n e s s</strong>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in <em>Humanity.</em> 
    <br>    
    <br>    
    some <em>understanding</em> and, 
    <br>at times, acts of <em>courage</em>
</p>
<p>
but all in all it is a mass, 
    <br>a glob that doesn't have too much.
</p>

<p>
it is like a large animal deep in sleep
    <br>and almost nothing can awaken it.
</p>
<p>
when activated it's best at brutality, 
    <br>selfishness, unjust judgments, murder.
</p>
<p>
    what can we do with it, this <strong>humanity?</strong> 
    <br>nothing.
</p>
<p>
avoid the thing as much as possible. 
    <br>treat it as you would anything 
</p>
<p>
poisonous, vicious and mindless. 
</p>
<p>
but be careful. it has enacted laws 
    <br>to protect itself from you.
</p>

<p>
it can kill you without cause. 
    <br>
and to escape it you must be subtle. 
   <br> 
       few escape.
</p>
<p>
it's up to you to figure a plan.
    <br>
I have met nobody who has escaped.
</p>
<p>
I have met some of the great and famous 
    <br>
    but they have not escaped
    <br>
    for they are only great and famous within 
    <br>
    <em>humanity.</em>
</p>
<p>
I have not escaped 
    <br>but I have not failed in trying 
    <br>again 
    <br>and again.
    <br>
    <br>
before my death I hope to 
    <strong>obtain my life.</strong>
