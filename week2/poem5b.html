<h1>        
what can we do? 
    <em>by charles bukowski</em>
    <hr>
    <br>

    at their best, there is gentleness in <em>Humanity.</em>
<br>
some understanding and, at times, acts of courage
    <br>
    <br>
    but all in all it is a <em>mass,</em> 
<br>
a glob that doesn't have too much.
    <br>
    <br>
it is like a large animal deep in sleep 
    <br>
and almost nothing can awaken it.
    <br>
    <br>

when activated it's best at brutality,
    <br>selfishness, 
unjust judgments, murder.
    <br>
    <br>

what can we do with it, this Humanity?
    <br>nothing.
    <br>
    <br>
avoid the thing as much as possible. 
    <br>
treat it as you would anything poisonous, 
    <br>

vicious and mindless. 
    <br>
but be careful. 
    <br>
    <br>
it has enacted laws to protect itself from you.
    <br>
it can kill you without cause. 
    <br>
    <br>
and to escape it you must be subtle. 
few escape.
    <br>
it's up to you to figure a plan.
    <br>
    <br>
I have met nobody who has escaped.
    <br>
I have met some of the great and 
    <br>
    <br>
famous but they have not escaped 
    <br>
for they are only great and famous within Humanity.
    <br>
    <br>
I have not escaped 
    <br>
but I have not failed 
    <br>in trying again 
and again.
    <br>
    <br>
before my death I hope to obtain my life.
