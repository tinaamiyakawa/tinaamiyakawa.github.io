what can we do?

<p>
at their best, there is gentleness in Humanity.
    <br>
some understanding and, at times, 
acts of courage
</p>
<p>but all in all it is a mass, 
    <br>
a glob that doesn't
have too much.
</p>
<p>
it is like a large animal deep in sleep 
    <br>
and almost nothing can awaken it.
</p> 
<p>
when activated it's best at brutality,
selfishness, 
    <br>
    unjust judgments, murder.
</p>
<p>
what can we do with it, this Humanity?
    <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing.
</p>
<p>
avoid the thing as much as possible.
    <br>
treat it as you would anything 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poisonous, 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    vicious and 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mindless.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
</p>
<p>
but be careful. 
    <br>it has enacted laws to protect
itself from you.
</p>
<p>
it can kill you without cause.
    <br>
and to escape it you must be subtle.
few escape.
</p>

<p>
it's up to you to figure a plan.
</p>
<p>
I have met nobody who has escaped.
</p>
<p>
I have met some of the great and
    <br>
famous but they have not escaped
    <br>
for they are only great and famous within
Humanity.
</p>
<p>
I have not escaped
    <br>
but I have not failed in trying again 
    <br>
    and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again.
</p>
    <br>
<p>
before my death I hope to obtain my
life.
</p>
    <br>
