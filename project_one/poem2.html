<p>   
at their best, there is gentleness in Humanity. 
    <br>
some understanding and, at times, acts of courage
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but all in all it is a mass, 
    <br>
a glob that doesn't have too much.
</p>

<p>
it is like a large animal deep in sleep 
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and almost nothing can awaken it.
</p>
<p>
when activated it's best at brutality, selfishness, 
    <br>
unjust judgments, murder.
</p>
<p>
what can we do with it, this Humanity? 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing.
</p>
<p>
avoid the thing as much as possible. 
    <br>
treat it as you would anything 
</p>
<p>
poisonous, vicious and mindless. 
</p>
<p>
but be careful. 
    <br>
it has enacted laws to protect itself from you.
</p>

<p>
it can kill you without cause. 
and to escape it you must be subtle. 
   <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       few escape.
</p>
<p>
it's up to you to figure a plan.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have met nobody who has escaped.
</p>
<p>
I have met some of the great and
    <br>
famous but they have not escaped 
    <br>
for they are only great and famous within 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Humanity.
</p>
<p>
I have not escaped 
    <br>
but I have not failed in trying again 
    <br>
and again.
</p>

<p>
before my death I hope to obtain my life.
