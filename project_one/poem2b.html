<h2>
what can we do? 
<br>
by charles bukowski
</h2>
<div>
    at their best, there is <h2>g e n t l e n e s s</h2>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in <em>Humanity.</em> 
    <br>    
    <br>    
    some <em>understanding</em> and, 
    <br>at times, acts of <em>courage</em>
</div>

<h2>
    <p>
but all in all it is a mass, 
    <br>a glob that doesn't have too much.
    </p>
</h2>
<div>
    it is like a large animal deep in <h2>sleep</h2>
    <br>and almost nothing can <strong>awaken it.</strong>
</div>
    <h3>
when activated it's best at brutality, 
    <br>selfishness, unjust judgments, murder.
</h3>
<p>
    what can we do with it, this <strong>humanity?</strong> 
    <br>nothing.
</p>
<p>
avoid the thing as much as possible. 
    <br>treat it as you would anything 
</p>
<h2>
poisonous, vicious and mindless. 
</h2>
<p>
but be careful. it has enacted <strong>laws</strong> 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>to protect itself from you.</em>
</p>

<h3>
it can kill you without cause. 
</h3>
    <br>
and to escape it you must be <em>subtle.</em> 
   <br> 
       few 
<h3>escape.</h3>
        
<p>it's up to you to figure a plan.
    <br>
I have met nobody who has escaped.</p>

<div>
I have met some of the 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<h2>great and f a m o u s</h2> 
    <br>
    but they have not escaped
    <br>
    for they are only great and famous within 
    <br>
    <em>humanity.</em>
</div>

<div>
    I have not <em>escaped</em> 
    <br>
    
<h2>but I have not failed in trying </h2>
    <br>again 
    <br>and 
    <br>
    again.
    <br>
    <br>
before my death I hope to 
obtain my <h2>life.</h2>
    
</div>
