        <h1>what can we do? <br>by charles bukowski</h1>

        <p>at their best, there is gentleness</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in <em>Humanity.</em> <br><br>some <em>understanding</em> and,
            <br>at times,</p>
        
        <h1>acts of <em>courage</em></h1>
            <p>but all in all it is a mass, <br>a glob that doesn't have too much.</p>
            <p>it is like a large animal deep in sleep
                <br>and almost nothing can <strong>awaken it.</strong></p>
  
        <h1>when activated it's best at brutality <br>selfishness, unjust judgments, murder.</h1>
   
    what can we do with it, this <strong>humanity?</strong> 
    <br>nothing.
    
avoid the thing as much as possible. 
    <br>treat it as you would anything 


poisonous, vicious and mindless. 

    but be careful. <br>
    it has enacted <strong>laws</strong> 
    <br><em>to protect itself from you.</em>
   

it can kill you without cause. 

    <br>
and to escape it you must be <em>subtle.</em> 
   <br> 
       few 
escape.
<p>
it's up to you to figure a plan.
    <br>
I have met nobody who has escaped.
</p>


I have met some of the 
great and famous
    <br>

<h1>
but they have not escaped
    <br>
    for they are only great and famous within 
    <br>
    <em>humanity.</em>
    I have not <em>escaped</em> 
    <br>
</h1>    
 
but I have not failed in trying
 
    again 
    <br>and 
    <br>
    again.
    <br>
    <br>
<h1>
before my death I hope to 
obtain my life.
