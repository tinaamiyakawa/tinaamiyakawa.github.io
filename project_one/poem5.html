<p>
what can we do? 
    <br>
by charles bukowski
</p>
 
at their best, there is gentleness in Humanity. some understanding and, at times, acts of courage
<p>
but all in all it is a mass, a glob that doesn't have too much.
</p>

<p>
it is like a large animal deep in sleep and almost nothing can awaken it.
</p>
<p>
when activated it's best at brutality, selfishness, unjust judgments, murder.
</p>
<p>
what can we do with it, this Humanity? 
nothing.
</p>
<p>
avoid the thing as much as possible. treat it as you would anything 
</p>
<p>
poisonous, vicious and mindless. 
</p>
<p>
but be careful. it has enacted laws to protect itself from you.
</p>

<p>
it can kill you without cause. 
and to escape it you must be subtle. 
   <br> 
       few escape.
</p>
<p>
it's up to you to figure a plan.
I have met nobody who has escaped.
</p>
<p>
I have met some of the great and famous but they have not escaped for they are only great and famous within humanity.
</p>
<p>
I have not escaped but I have not failed in trying again and again.
before my death I hope to obtain my life.
