        <p> Is this the end? I’ve been excited about her newest book, Conflict Is Not Abuse, since I heard its premise: Schulman argues that in intimate relationships, in our communities, and in global politics, there is the tendency to “overstate harm” — to claim that the most endangered are instead dangerous. <em>THIS IS IT!!!!</em> This is done to justify making them objects of anxiety, separation, and punishment. The dominant forces — be it an abusive lover in a relationship, a society that insists that citizens would not be killed by police if they only presented themselves correctly, or governments that insist they are being attacked by refugees, the poor, or immigrants — claim their own innocence. And they also assert that those who do not conform are an active threat.</p>
